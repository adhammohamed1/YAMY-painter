## Project Description
Object-oriented paint program which allows the user to unleash their inner Da Vinci!. GUI was designed mainly using javax.swing.  

## Project Functionalities
**This app helps the user unleash their inner Da Vinci! The user can:**
1. Free paint using a brush with variable stroke/thickness ( Antialiasing got you covered ;) )
2. Erase using eraser tool
3. Draw geometric shapes (Line Segment, Circle, Square, Rectangle, Triangle)
4. Change drawing color and stroke
5. Fill shapes with any color
6. Undo and redo any action ***( I actually designed a custom algorithm for that :D )***
7. Move shapes around
8. Resize shapes
9. Copy and paste shapes as many times as you like!
10. Clear the screen
11. Automatic screenshot of your masterpiece with every change! Manual screenshot button is also present.

## Tools, Libraries & Implementations
1. IntelliJ IDEA (IDE)
2. Java 
3. Javax.swing
4. Graphic libraries like java.awt and javax.imageio
5. Creately for UMLs diagrams
6. LaTeX for writing documentation
7. Maintained S.O.L.I.D principles
8. Implemented 6 design patterns

## Deployment
To run the program, you have to run the class named "FinalProjectPaint_V1" as your main class with Java SDK 16

## Design Patterns
**1. Factory Design Pattern**
We have used Factory design patter in order to create new Objects
without need of construction and to avoid coupling and dependency
between Classes. So we constructed new instances of classes through
this factory and returning it in needed methods or classes

**2. Prototype Design Pattern**
We have used Prototype design pattern by implementing “Cloneable”
interface and implementing “clone()” method in each and every Shape
class and also Cloning instances of “Point” class. It helped us making
copies of our Objects using values not references that helped us in
copy method.

**3. Singleton Design Pattern**
We have used Singleton design pattern to assure the creation of only
one object of “ScreenShotter” class which has main aim to take
screenshot of the painting board and it is the only instance that is
allowed to do such task.

**4. Façade Design Pattern**
We have used façade design pattern as it offers a simple interface to
more complex underlying objects. So we could use draw methods
using objects of “ShapeMakerFacade” class and not by accessing the
shapes classes itself.

**5. Iterator Design Pattern**
Iterator design Pattern facilitates looping across the array list of
Geometric shapes needed to be drawn by only using 2 basic methods
which are : “hasNext()” and “next()” avoiding looping with varying
conditions.

**6. Iterator Design Pattern**
Observer design pattern helped us with automatic
screenshotting(update method) while drawing (auto-documentation) as
it takes screenshot each and every time we release the mouse by only
changing the state in the PaintBoard class.

## S.O.L.I.D Principles
**1. Single-Responsibility Principle**
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job, that's why we made classes like ShapeCopier, ShapeFiller, ShapeMover and ShapeResizer. Those classes are only responsiple for one job as shown from their names.

**2. Open-Closed Principle**
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification, so if anyone wants to contribute to project and add another shape, he can do so effortlessly by adding a class and extending it from "GeometricShape" class.

**3. Interface Segregation Principle**
Each method in each class is there for a reason, there is no unused method, so if you are adding extra shape, you probably won't be forced to implement a method you won't use.
