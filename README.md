# YAMY-painter
Object Oriented Paint Program using Java Swing

This app helps the user unleash their inner Da Vinci! The user can:
1. Free paint using a brush with variable stroke/thickness ( Antialiasing got you covered ;) )
2. Erase using eraser tool
3. Draw geometric shapes (Line Segment, Circle, Square, Rectangle, Triangle)
4. Fill shapes with any color
5. Move shapes around
6. Resize shapes
7. Copy and paste shapes as many times as they like!

The user could also:
1. Screenshot their masterpiece!
2. Undo and redo ( A custom algorithm has been designed for that :D )

The following is a report of the whole program : [paint_Final.pdf](https://github.com/adhammohamed1/YAMY-painter/files/7531955/paint_Final.pdf)

*Excuse my evidently limited drawing skills :)*
